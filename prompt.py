Example Response:
"Hi Henry! I hear you're having some trouble managing time with your Reflective Assessment 3. Don't worry - it happens to many students. The best thing to do is email our UX team at uxd at noroff dot no about trying again.
Now, about your project - I'm really impressed! Your interview script and research plan show great thinking. And those goals you set? They're exactly what we're looking for. Using a chart to map out your research process was a smart choice.
I noticed you mentioned struggling with the competitive analysis, especially the UI elements. Let me help with that. Think about looking at three main things: how simple the layout is, what colors they're using, and how people interact with it. You might find it helpful to use something called a SWOT framework - that stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.
You're definitely moving in the right direction here. The feedback from Donjeta, combined with how well you're reflecting on your work, shows me you're really committed to doing great work. Keep these ideas in mind as you move forward - you're going to do great!"
